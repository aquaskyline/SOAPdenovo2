**********************************************************
Introduction

SOAPdenovo is a novel short-read assembly method that can build a de novo draft assembly for the human-sized genomes. The program is specially designed to assemble Illumina GA short reads. It creates new opportunities for building reference sequences and carrying out accurate analyses of unexplored genomes in a cost effective way.

************
System Requirement

SOAPdenovo aims for large plant and animal genomes, although it also works well on bacteria and fungi genomes.  It runs on 64-bit Linux system with a minimum of 5G physical memory. For big genomes like human, about 150 GB memory would be required.

************
Update Log

1) 63mer and 127mer versions were merged.

2) A new module named "sparse-pregraph" was added which can reduce considerable computational comsumption.

3) "Multi-kmer" method was introduced in "contig" step which allows the utilization of the advantages of small and large kmer.

4) Algorithm of scaffolding was improved to get longer and more accuracy scaffolds.

5) AIO (Asynchronous Input/Output) was introduced to boost the performance of reading files.

6) Information for visualization purpose was available after scaffolding.

7) Several bugs fixed.

************
Installation
1. You can download the pre-compiled binary according to your platform, unpack using "tar -zxf  ${destination folder} download.tgz" and execute directly.
2. Or download the source code, unpack to ${destination folder} with the method above, and compile by using GNU make with command "make" at ${destination folder}/SOAPdenovo-V2.04. Then install executable to ${destination folder}/SOAPdenovo-V2.04/bin using "make install"

How to use it

1. Configuration file

For big genome projects with deep sequencing, the data is usually organized as multiple read sequence files generated from multiple libraries. The configuration file tells the assembler where to find these files and the relevant information. "example.config" is an example of such a file.

The configuration file has a section for global information, and then multiple library sections. Right now only "max_rd_len" is included in the global information section. Any read longer than max_rd_len will be cut to this length. 

The library information and the information of sequencing data generated from the library should be organized in the corresponding library section. Each library section starts with tag [LIB] and includes the following items:
1) avg_ins
   This value indicates the average insert size of this library or the peak value position in the insert size distribution figure.
2) reverse_seq
   This option takes value 0 or 1. It tells the assembler if the read sequences need to be complementarily reversed. 
Illumima GA produces two types of paired-end libraries: a) forward-reverse, generated from fragmented DNA ends with typical insert size less than 500 bp; b) reverse-forward, generated from circularizing libraries with typical insert size greater than 2 Kb. The parameter "reverse_seq" should be set to indicate this: 0, forward-reverse; 1, reverse-forward.
3) asm_flags
   This indicator decides in which part(s) the reads are used. It takes value 1(only contig assembly), 2 (only scaffold assembly), 3(both contig and scaffold assembly), or 4 (only gap closure).
4) rd_len_cutof
   The assembler will cut the reads from the current library to this length.
5) rank
   It takes integer values and decides in which order the reads are used for scaffold assembly. Libraries with the same "rank" are used at the same time during scaffold assembly. 
6) pair_num_cutoff
   This parameter is the cutoff value of pair number for a reliable connection between two contigs or pre-scaffolds. The minimum number for paired-end reads and mate-pair reads is 3 and 5 respectively.
7) map_len
   This takes effect in the "map" step and is the minimun alignment length between a read and a contig required for a reliable read location. The minimum length for paired-end reads and mate-pair reads is 32 and 35 respectively.

The assembler accepts read file in three kinds of formats: FASTA, FASTQ and BAM. Mate-pair relationship could be indicated in two ways: two sequence files with reads in the same order belonging to a pair, or two adjacent reads in a single file (FASTA only) belonging to a pair. If a read in bam file fails platform/vendor quality checks(the flag field 0x0200 is set), itself and it's paired read would be ignored.

In the configuration file single end files are indicated by "f=/path/filename" or "q=/pah/filename" for fasta or fastq formats separately. Paired reads in two fasta sequence files are indicated by "f1=" and "f2=". While paired reads in two fastq sequences files are indicated by "q1=" and "q2=". Paired reads in a single fasta sequence file is indicated by "p=" item. Reads in bam sequence files is indicated by "b=".

All the above items in each library section are optional. The assembler assigns default values for most of them. If you are not sure how to set a parameter, you can remove it from your configuration file.

2. Get it started
Once the configuration file is available, a typical way to run the assembler is:
${bin} all -s config_file -K 63 -R -o graph_prefix 1>ass.log 2>ass.err

User can also choose to run the assembly process step by step as:
step1:
${bin} pregraph -s config_file -K 63 -R -o graph_prefix 1>pregraph.log 2>pregraph.err  
OR
${bin} sparse_pregraph -s config_file -K 63 -z 5000000000 -R -o graph_prefix 1>pregraph.log 2>pregraph.err 

step2:
${bin} contig -g graph_prefix -R 1>contig.log 2>contig.err

step3:
${bin} map -s config_file -g graph_prefix 1>map.log 2>map.err

step4:
${bin} scaff -g graph_prefix -F 1>scaff.log 2>scaff.err

a. *.contig	
  contig sequences without using mate pair information.
b. *.scafSeq	
  scaffold sequences (final contig sequences can be extracted by breaking down scaffold sequences at gap regions).

4.2 There are some other files that provide useful information for advanced users, which are listed in Appendix B.

5. FAQ

5.1 How to set K-mer size?

The program accepts odd numbers between 13 and 31. Larger K-mers would have higher rate of uniqueness in the genome and would make the graph simpler, but it requires deep sequencing depth and longer read length to guarantee the overlap at any genomic location.

The sparse pregraph module usually needs 2-10bp smaller kmer length to achieve the same performance as the original pregraph module.

5.2 How to set genome size(-z) for sparse pregraph module?

The -z parameter for sparse pregraph should be set a litter larger than the real genome size, it is used to allocate memory.

5.3 How to set library rank?

SOAPdenovo will use the pair-end libraries with insert size from smaller to larger to construct scaffolds. Libraries with the same rank would be used at the same time. For example, in a dataset of a human genome, we set five ranks for five libraries with insert size 200-bp, 500-bp, 2-Kb, 5-Kb and 10-Kb, separately. It is desired that the pairs in each rank provide adequate physical coverage of the genome.

   b. *.edge 
      Each record gives the information of an edge in the pre-graph: length, Kmers on both ends, average kmer coverage, whether it's reverse-complementarily identical and the sequence.
   c. *.markOnEdge & *.path
      These two files are for using reads to solve small repeats.
   e. *.preArc
      Connections between edges which are established by the read paths.
   f. *.vertex
      Kmers at the ends of edges.
   g. *.preGraphBasic

2. Output files from the command "contig"
   a. *.contig
      Contig information: corresponding edge index, length, kmer coverage, whether it's tip and the sequence. Either a contig or its reverse complementry counterpart is included. Each reverse complementary contig index is indicated in the *.ContigIndex file.
   b. *.Arc
      Arcs coming out of each edge and their corresponding coverage by reads 
   c. *.updated.edge
